### 红颜劫
##### The Calamity of Beauty
##### 《甄嬛传》主题曲---《红颜劫》
 

斩断情丝心犹乱  
Severing love tie, I still feel perturbed  
千头万绪仍纠缠  
With a potpourri of thoughts on my mind   
拱手让江山  
Rather than rule over a land  
低眉恋红颜  
I prefer a fair lady by my side  
祸福轮流转  
Ceaseless, the wheel of fortune goes on still  
是劫还是缘  
No one knows whether it bodes well or ill  
天机算不尽  
Of what waits in future, I can’t tell all  
交织悲与欢  
Joy and sorrow will follow, and mingle  
古今痴男女  
Timeless is the failure of those in love  
谁能过情关  
The spell of romance, who can survive
