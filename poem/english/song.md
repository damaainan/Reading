### 红颜劫
##### The Calamity of Beauty
##### 《甄嬛传》主题曲---《红颜劫》
 

斩断情丝心犹乱  
Severing love tie, I still feel perturbed  
千头万绪仍纠缠  
With a potpourri of thoughts on my mind   
拱手让江山  
Rather than rule over a land  
低眉恋红颜  
I prefer a fair lady by my side  
祸福轮流转  
Ceaseless, the wheel of fortune goes on still  
是劫还是缘  
No one knows whether it bodes well or ill  
天机算不尽  
Of what waits in future, I can’t tell all  
交织悲与欢  
Joy and sorrow will follow, and mingle  
古今痴男女  
Timeless is the failure of those in love  
谁能过情关  
The spell of romance, who can survive

and you forever.

### When you are old 当你老了--- William Butler Yeats ——威廉·巴特勒·叶芝  

When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 当你老了，头发花白，睡意沉沉，  
And nodding by the fire，take down this book, 倦坐在炉边，取下这本书来，  
And slowly read,and dream of the soft look 慢慢读着，追梦当年的眼神  
Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep; 你那柔美的神采与深幽的晕影。  
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 多少人爱过你昙花一现的身影，  
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 爱过你的美貌，以虚伪或真情，  
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you 惟独一人曾爱你那朝圣者的心，  
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 爱你哀戚的脸上岁月的留痕。  
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 在炉罩边低眉弯腰，  
Murmur,a little sadly,how Love fled 忧戚沉思，喃喃而语，  
And paced upon the mountains overhead 爱情是怎样逝去，又怎样步上群山，  
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 怎样在繁星之间藏住了脸。

The night is young  
          夜未央  
The music is loud  
          乐未殇

### 手嶌葵《The Rose》
Some say love it is a river昔闻人道，爱若溪河   
That drowns the tender reed.有苇柔柔，入水而没   
Some say love it is a razor昔闻人言，爱若刀割   
That leaves your soul to bleed.有心落落，空留伤痕   
Some say love it is a hunger昔闻人语，爱若饥壑   
An endless aching need.有欲绵绵，永无止渴   
I say love it is a flower我谓此爱，春上新芳   
And you it's only seed.唯君硕果，寄我衷肠   
It's the heart afraid of breaking彼心颤颤，恐失方寸   
That never learns to dance.岂知曼舞，精妙无双   
It's the dream afraid of waking彼梦徊徊，恐化泡影   
That never takes the chance.岂知良缘，虽渺必往   
It's the one who won't be taken啬啬庸人，咫尺不让   
Who cannot seem to give,岂知相与，蹈火赴汤   
And the soul afraid of dyin'栗栗孤魂，恐成新亡   
That never learns to live.岂知此生，莫虚年华   
When the night has been too lonely秋风渐冷，孤影月下   
And the road has been too long,望眼欲穿，长路无涯   
And you think that love is only心疑此情，错付谁家   
For the lucky and the strong,或有幸者，强忍可达   
Just remember in the winter谨记莫忘，纵在凛冬   
Far beneath the bitter snows寒风凛凛，层层雪落   
Lies the seed that with the sun's love壤中静候，粒粒新果   
In the spring becomes the rose.春光洒时，盛放玫瑰

执子之手，承汝之忧。  
愿为甜酿，盈汝之杯。  
但如明烛，为汝之光。  
永佩此誓，与汝偕老。  
  
With this hand,I will lift your sorrows.    
Your cup will never empty,for I will be your wine.    
With this candle,I will light your way in darkness.    
With this ring, I ask you to be mine. ​​​​
