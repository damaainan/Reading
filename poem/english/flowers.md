最近在美国很火的一首小诗，每个人都有自己的节奏，好的时候别得意忘形，坏的时候别灰心丧气，那只是一时一刻你的节奏罢了。

纽约时间比加州时间早三个小时  
New York is 3 hours ahead of California,   
  
但加州时间并没有变慢。   
but it does not make California slow.   
  
有人22岁就毕业了，   
Someone graduated at the age of 22,   
  
但等了五年才找到好的工作！  
but waited 5 years before securing a good job!   
  
有人25岁就当上CEO，   
Someone became a CEO at 25,   
  
却在50岁去世。   
and died at 50.   
  
也有人迟到50岁才当上CEO，   
While another became a CEO at 50,   
  
然后活到90岁。   
and lived to 90 years.   
  
有人依然单身，   
Someone is still single,   
  
同时也有人已婚。   
while someone else got married.   
  
奥巴马55岁就退休，   
Obama retires at 55,   
  
川普70岁才开始当总统。   
but Trump starts at 70.   
  
世上每个人本来就有自己的发展时区。   
Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.   
  
身边有些人看似走在你前面，  
People around you might seem to go ahead of you,   
  
也有人看似走在你后面。   
some might seem to be behind you.   
  
但其实每个人在自己的时区有自己的步程。   
But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.   
  
不用嫉妒或嘲笑他们。   
Don’t envy them or mock them.   
  
他们都在自己的时区里，你也是！   
They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!   
  
生命就是等待正确的行动时机。  
Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.   
  
所以，放轻松。   
So, RELAX.   
  
你没有落后。   
You’re not LATE.   
  
你没有领先。   
You’re not EARLY.   
  
在命运为你安排的属于自己的时区里，一切都准时。   
You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.

西江月·梅花

玉骨那愁瘴雾，冰姿自有仙风。

海仙时遣探芳丛，倒挂绿毛幺凤。

素面翻嫌粉涴，洗妆不褪唇红。

高情已逐晓云空，不与梨花同梦。

Bones of jade, flesh of snow,

May thy ethereal spirit stand unafraid .

Though the dark mist and the swamp wind blow.

May the sea sprites attend thee,

The para Quets and cockatoos befriend three,

Thy white face doth powder spurn,

Vermilion must yet from thy lips learn.

Flesh of snow, bones of jade,

Dream thy dreams,peerless one,

Not for this world thou art made.

《水调歌头·明月几时有》 

丙辰中秋，欢饮达旦，大醉，作此篇。兼怀子由。 

明月几时有？ 把酒问青天。不知天上宫阙，今夕是何年。 

我欲乘风归去，又恐琼楼玉宇，高处不胜寒。 

起舞弄清影，何似在人间！ 

转朱阁，低绮户，照无眠。

不应有恨，何事长向别时圆？ 

人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全。 

但愿人长久，千里共婵娟。

How rare the moon, so round and clear! 

With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky,

"I do not know in the celestial sphere 

What name this festive night goes by?” 

I want to fly home, riding the air, 

But fear the ethereal cold up there, 

The jade and crystal mansions are so high! 

Dancing to my shadow, 

I feel no longer the mortal tie. 

She rounds the vermilion tower, 

Stoops to silk-pad doors, 

Shines on those who sleepless lie. 

Why does she, bearing us no grudge, 

Shine upon our parting, reunion deny? 

But rare is perfect happiness-- 

The moon does wax, the moon does wane,

And so men meet and say goodbye. 

I only pray our life be long, 

And our souls together heavenward fly!

江城子·乙卯正月二十日夜记梦

十年生死两茫茫，不思量，自难忘。

千里孤坟，无处话凄凉。

纵使相逢应不识，尘满面，鬓如霜。

夜来幽梦忽还乡，小轩窗，正梳妆。

相顾无言，惟有泪千行。

料得年年肠断处，明月夜，短松冈。

Ten years have we been parted: 

The living and the dead—— 

Hearing no news 

Not thinking 

And yet forgetting nothing! 

I cannot come to your grave a thousand miles away 

To converse with you and whisper my longing; 

And even if we did meet 

How would you greet 

My weathered face, my hair a frosty white ? 

Last night 

I dreamed I had suddenly returned to our old home 

And saw you sitting there before the familiar dressing table, 

We looked at each other in silence, 

With misty eyes beneath the candle-light .

May we year after year 

In heartbreak meet 

On the pine-crest 

In the moonlight!

临江仙·夜饮东坡醒复醉

夜饮东坡醒复醉，归来仿佛三更。

家童鼻息已雷鸣。

敲门都不应，倚杖听江声。 

长恨此身非我有，何时忘却营营。

夜阑风静縠纹平。

小舟从此逝，江海寄余生。

After a drink at night,Tungpo wakes up and gets drunk again. 

By the time I come home it seems to midnight , 

The boy servant is asleep snoring like thunder , 

And does not answer the door . 

Resting on a cane I listen to the murmur of the river , 

And feel with a pang that I am not master of my own life . 

When can I stop this hustling about? 

The night is late,the air is calm, 

And the water a sheen of unruffled light. 

Let me take a small boat down the river hence 

To spend beyond the seas the remainder of my days.

沁园春·赴密州早行马上寄子由

孤馆灯青，野店鸡号，旅枕梦残。渐月华收练。晨霜耿耿，云山摛锦，朝露团团。世路无穷，劳生有限，似此区区长鲜欢。微吟罢，凭征鞍无语，往事千端。 

当时共客长安，似二陆初来俱少年。

有笔头千字，胸中万卷，致君尧舜，此事何难。

用舍由时，行藏在我,袖手何妨闲处看。

身长健，但优游卒岁，且斗樽前。

A Ione dim lamp in a quiet room;

At the wayside inn a cock crows.

On a traveler's, pillow lie unfinished dreams.

Declining moon gathers up its beams.

The morning frost covers the hills like a brocade,

Which sparkles with the pearly dew.

Human toil fill life's endless journey,

Freshened now and then with moments of joy.

Holding the reins in silence,

I thought of the myriad things that had gone by

I look back upon those days

When we stopped together at Changan,

Like the two Lus,

Both inspired by the high hopes of youth.

With a thousand words from our pens

And ten thousand volumes in our breasts,

We thought it not difficult to make our Emperor the best.

Whether to serve or to retire

Depends entirely now upon ourselves.

Why not fold our hands in our sleeves and leisurely watch?

May we remain forever in good health,

And spend the Iast years of our Iives at ease—Over a contest of wine!
