《幽梦影》——林语堂译（人生卷） 

### 人生——之一

情之一字，所以维持世界；才之一字，所以粉饰乾坤。  

* （吴）雨若曰：世界原从情字生出。有夫妇然后有父子，有父子然后有兄弟，有兄弟然后
有朋友，有朋友然后有君臣。  

* 批注者于书中初见，即加注姓氏，以便读者。  

Passion holds up the bottom of the universe, and the poet gives it a new dress.   
Yujo: All human life begins with love between man and woman, from which the other human
relationships such as between father and son and between brothers follow.   

### 人生——之二

情必近于痴而始真，才必兼乎趣而始化。  
（陆）云士曰：真情种，真才子，能为此言。  
（顾）天石曰：才兼乎趣，非心斋不足当之。  
（尤）慧珠曰：余情而痴则有之，才而趣则未能也。  
Love is not true love without a form of madness. A literary artist must have zest in life to enter
into nature's spirit.   
Yunshih: Here speaks a born lover and artist.   
Tienshih: Shintsai really understands the zest of life besides being a literary artist.   

[Miss] Hueichu: I think I know the passion of love, but I have not the zest combined with talent.   

### 人生——之三

律己宜带秋气，处世宜带春气。  
One should discipline oneself in the spirit of autumn and live with others in the spirit of spring.   

### 人生——之四

能闲世人之所忙者，方能忙世人之所闲。  
Only those who take leisurely what the people of the world are busy about can be busy about what
the people of the world take leisurely.   

### 人生——之五

人莫乐于闲，非无所事事之谓也。闲则能读书，闲则能游名胜，闲则能交益友，闲则能饮酒，
闲则能著书。天下之乐，孰大于是？
（陈）隺山曰：然则正是极忙处。  
（尤）悔庵曰：昔人云，忙里偷闲，闲则而偷，盗亦有道矣。  
（李）若金曰：闲固难得，有此五者，方不负闲字。  
Of all things one enjoys leisure most, not because one does nothing. Leisure confers upon one the
freedom to read, to travel, to make friends, to drink, and to write. Where is there a greater pleasure
than this?
Hoshan: Then you are really busy.   
Huei-an: The proverb says, “Steal leisure from business.” It can be stolen methodically.   
Jochin: Those five things make leisure really worthwhile.   

### 人生——之六

妾美不如妻贤，钱多不如境顺。  
（张）竹坡曰：此所谓竿头欲进步者。然妻不贤安用妾美，钱不多那得境顺。  
（张）迂庵曰：此盖谓两者不可得兼，舍一而取一者也。又曰：世固有钱多而境不顺者。  
I think it is better to have an understanding wife than a pretty concubine, and better to have peace
of mind than wealth.   
[Nephew] Chupo: There is no limit to desires. How can one expect to have a pretty concubine
without first having an understanding wife? And how can one have peace of mind without plenty
of money?
Yu-an: He means a choice of alternatives. And there are indeed people with plenty of money but
no peace of mind.   

### 人生——之七

值太平世，生湖山郡，官长廉静，家道优裕，娶妻贤淑，生子聪慧，人生如此，可云全福。  
（许）筱林曰：若以 直 愚蠢之?当之，则负却造物。  
（江）含噅曰：此是黑面老子，要思量做鬼处。  
（吴）岱观曰：过屠门而大嚼，虽不得肉，亦觉快意。  
（李）荔园曰：贤淑聪慧，尤贵永年，否则福不全。  
The perfect life: to live in a world of peace in a lake district where the magistrate is good and
honest, and to have an understanding wife and bright children.   
Shiaolin: It would be a pity to have a vulgarian enjoy all this.   
Hanchen: Here is a black-faced Laotse thinking of becoming a devil.   
Taikuan: Yes, and rather like imagining eating a juicy steak before a butcher's shop window!
Liyuan: An understanding wife, yes, but also a long life. Otherwise the blessing is not complete.   

### 人生——之八

有功夫读书，谓之福；有力量济人，谓之福；有学问著述，谓之福；无是非到耳，谓之福；
有多闻直谅之友，谓之福。  
（杨）圣藻曰：在我者可必，在人者不能必。  
（王）丹麓曰：备此福者，惟我心斋。  
（李）水樵曰：五福骈臻固佳，苟得其半者，亦不得谓之无福。  
（倪）永清曰：直谅之友，富贵人久拒之矣，何心斋反求之也？
Blessed are those who have time for reading, money to help others, the learning and ability to
write, who are not bothered with gossip and disputes, and who have learned friends frank with
advice.   
Shengtsao: We can take care of those things which depend on ourselves, but not those which
depend on others.   
Tanlu: Shintsai has them all.   
Shuichiao: I would be satisfied with half of these five.   
Yungching: I thought successful men never wanted friends with frank advice. Shintsai asks for
them instead!

### 人生——之九

不治生产，其后必致累人；专务交游，其后必致累己。  
圣藻曰：晨钟夕磬，发人深省。  
（冒）巢民曰：若在我，虽累己累人，亦所不悔。  
（宗）子发曰：累己犹可，若累人则不可矣。  
含徵曰：今之人未必肯受你累，还是自家隐些的好。  
Those who despise money end up by sponging on their friends; those who mix freely with all sorts
of people will eventually hurt themselves.   
Shengtsao: What a profound warning!
Tsaomin: For myself, I do not regret it one way or the other.   
Tsefa: It does make a difference, though, whether you hurt others or only yourself.   
Hanchen: Nowadays people do not welcome being sponged up on. So it is better to be careful.   

### 人生——之十

胸中小不平，可以酒消之；世间大不平，非剑不能消也。  
（周）星远曰：看剑饮杯长，一切不平皆破除矣。  
迂庵曰：苍苍者未必肯以太阿假人，似不能代作空空儿也。  
悔庵曰：龙泉太阿，汝知我者，岂止苏子美以一斗读《汉书》耶？
A small injustice can be drowned by a cup of wine; a great injustice can be vanquished only by the
sword.   
Shingyuan: So you drown all sorrows by holding a cup of wine with a sword in sight.   
Yu-an:I do not think the Blessed Lord would easily give such a sword to men. It might raise more
trouble than it can settle.   
Huei-an: O, Lungchuan [famous wine] and Tai-o [famous sword], trust me! I can handle both!

### 人生——之十一

多情者必好色，而好色者未必尽属多情；红颜者必薄命，而薄命者未必尽属红颜；能诗者必
好酒，而好酒者未必尽属能诗。  
竹坡曰：情起于色者，则好色也，非情也。祸起于颜色者，则薄命在红颜，否则，亦止曰命
而已矣。  
（洪）秋士曰：世亦有能诗而不好酒者。  
A great lover loves women, but one who loves women is not necessarily a great lover. A beautiful
woman often has a tragic life, but not all those who have tragic lives are beautiful. A good poet
can always drink, but being a great drinker does not make one a poet.   
Chupo: Passion which is based on sex must after all be distinguished from true love. Tragedy
sometimes comes from being a great beauty, but sometimes has to connection with it, but is just
fate.   
Chiushih: There are poets who cannot drink.   

### 人生——之十二

有青山方有绿水，水惟借色于山；有美酒便有佳诗，诗亦乞灵于酒。  
（李）圣许曰：有青山绿水，乃可酌美酒而咏佳诗，是诗酒亦发端于山水也。  
Green hills come with blue waters which borrow their blueness from the hills; good wine produces
beautiful poems, which draw sustenance from the spirits.   
Shengshu: Green hills and blue waters make it possible to enjoy wine and poetry. So everything
goes back to the hills and waters.   

### 人生——之十三

酒可好不可骂座，色可好不可伤生，财可好不可昧心，气可好不可越理。  
（袁）中江曰：如灌夫使酒，文园病肺，昨夜南塘一出，马上挟章台柳归，亦自无妨，觉愈
见英雄本色也。  
Drink by all means, but do not make drunken scenes; have women by all means, but do not
destroy your health; work for money by all means, but do not let it blot out your conscience; get
mad about something but do not go beyond reason.   
Chungchiang: There are some who go to excess and seem the more genuinely great for it.   

### 人生——之十四

天下无书则已，有则必当读；无酒则已，有则必当饮；无名山则已，有则必当赏玩；无才子
佳人则已，有则必当爱慕怜惜。  
弟木山曰：谈何容易，即我家黄山，几能得一到耶？
If there were no books, then nothing need be said about it, but since there are books, they must be
read; if there were no wine, then nothing need be said. But since there is, it must be drunk; since
there are famous mountains, they must be visited; since there are flowers and the moon, they must
be enjoyed; and since there are poets and beauties they must be loved and protected.   
[Younger brother] Mushan: Easier said than done. There is the famous Yellow Mountain right in
our district. But how many have visited it?

### 人生——之十五

不得已而谀之者，宁以口，毋以笔；不可耐而骂人者，亦宁以口，毋以笔。  
（张）豹人曰：但恐未必能自主耳。  
竹坡曰：上句立品，下句立德。  
迂庵曰：匪惟立德，亦以免祸。  
天石曰：今人笔不谀人，更无用笔之处矣。心斋不知此苦，还是唐宋以上人耳。  
云士曰：古笔铭曰：“毫毛茂茂，陷水可脱，陷文不活。”正此谓也。亦有谄以笔而实讥之者，
亦有以笔而若誉之者，总以不笔为高。  
If one has to praise someone, rather do it by word of mouth than by pen; if there are persons that
must be castigated, also do it by word of mouth rather than in writing.   
Paojen: You have no control over it sometimes.   
Chupo: The first half of the sentence helps one's integrity, the second half one's character.   
Yu-an: It not only helps character, but saves one from getting into trouble.   
Tienshih: There are writers today who find no other use for their pen except writing eulogies.   
Shintsai is not aware of the circumstances which force them to do it. He lives mentally in the
Golden Age.   
Yunshih: An ancient inscription on a pen says, “The little hair-brush. You can get out when dipped
in water, but when you get into writing, you may be crushed.” There are eulogies with
tongue-in-check sarcasms and apparent denunciations which cover real praise. But the best thing
is not to commit it to paper at all.   

### 人生——之十六

万事可忘，难忘者名心一段；千般易淡，未淡者美酒三杯。  
竹坡曰：是闻鸡起舞，酒后耳热气象。  
丹麓曰：予性不耐饮，美酒亦易淡，所最难忘者，名耳。  
云士曰：惟恐不好名，丹麓此言，具见真处。  
One can forget everything except the thought of fame, and learn to be cool toward everything
except three cups of wine.   
Chupo: Now I hear someone who is feeling hot behind the ears and who wants to get up at dawn
and practice fencing.   
Tanlu: I can't drink, but I cannot forget the thought of fame.   
Yunshih: It is not a bad occupation, this thought about fame. Tanlu is sincere.   

### 人生——之十七

物之能感人者，在天莫如月，在乐莫如琴，在动物莫如鹃，在植物莫如柳。  
Of all things in the universe, those that move men most deeply are the moon2 in heaven, the chin
in music, the cuckoo among birds, and the willow among plants.   

### 人生——之十八

阅《水浒传》，至鲁达打镇关西，武松打虎，因思人生必有一桩极快意事，方不枉在生一场。  
即不能有其事，亦须著得一种得意之书，庶几无憾耳。  
竹坡曰：此等事必须无意中方做得来。  
弟木山曰：兄若打中山狼更极快意。  
When you read the Shuihu and come to the passage where Luta smashes Chenkuanshi or where
Wusung kills the tiger with his bare hands, you feel good. A man must have such moments of
supreme satisfaction in his life. Then he will not have lived in vain. If he cannot, he can hope to
make up for it by writing a fine book.   
Chupo: Such moments of supreme satisfaction have to happen naturally. They cannot be striven
for.   
[Younger brother] Mushan: If elder brother could kill the Ungrateful Wolf [in a story], it would be
one of those moments.   

### 人生——之十九

胸藏丘壑，城市不异山林；兴寄烟霞，阎浮有如蓬岛。梧桐为植物中清品，而形家独忌之甚，
且谓梧桐大如斗，主人往外走……俗言之不足据，类如此夫。  
含徵曰：爱碧桐者遂艰于白镪。造物盖忌之，如靳之也，有何吉凶休咎之可关。只是打秋风
时，光棍样可厌耳。  
In possession of a lively imagination, one can live in the cities and feel like one is in the
mountains, and following one's fancies with the clouds, one can convert the dark continent of the
south into fairy isles. A great wrong has been committed on the plane tree by the necromancers
who regard it as bringing bad luck, saying that when a plane tree grows in the yard, its owner will
live abroad...Most superstitions are like that.   
Hanchen: Those who love the plane tree are often poor. But that is because the Lord does not want
us to have all the blessings at the same time. It is true, however, that in autumn its bare-knuckled
and knobbed branches are difficult to look at.   
2书中为 moon，疑为 moons

### 人生——之二十

有地上之山水，有画上之山水，有梦中之山水，有胸中之山水。地上者妙在邱壑深邃，画上
者妙在笔墨淋漓，梦中者妙在景象变幻，胸中者妙在位置自如。  
星远曰：心斋《幽梦影》中文字，其妙亦在景象变幻。  
（殷）日戒曰：若诗文中之山水，其幽深变幻，更不可以名状。  
含徵曰：但不可有面上之山水。  
（余）香祖曰：余境况不佳，水穷山尽矣。  
There are hills and waters on the earth, in paintings, in dreams, and in one's imagination. The
beauty of such hills and waters on the earth is in their grace and variety; that in paintings, richness
of ink and freedom of the brush; that in dreams, their changefulness; and that in one's imagination,
good composition.   
Shingyuan: The writing of this book has grace and variety also.   
Jihchieh: In literature, the changes and surprises are even more exciting and difficult to describe.   
Hanchen: But please not those changes of expression on the face (of snobbery, etc.)!
Shiangtsu: But sometimes when one meets hardships, the hills seem blocked and the waters come
to a dead end, as in my case.   

### 人生——之二十一

鳞虫中金鱼，羽虫中紫燕，可云物类神仙。正如东方曼倩避世金马门，人不得而害之。  
含徵曰：金鱼之所以免汤镬者，以其色胜而味苦耳。昔人有以重价觅奇特者，以馈邑侯。  
邑侯他日谓之曰：“贤所赠花鱼殊无味。”盖已烹之矣。世岂少削圆方竹杖者哉。  
Be a goldfish among the fish and a swallow among the birds. There are like Taoist fairies who go
through life like the witty Tungfang Manching, safe from harm from those in power.   
Hanchen: The goldfish escapes from harm because its flesh is bitter to the taste. Once there was a
man who paid a high price for a beautiful variety and sent it as a present to a magistrate. Later the
magistrate said to him, “The beautiful fish you sent me seemed to be perfectly tasteless." He
meant that he had cooked and tasted it. There are such people in the world!

### 人生——之二十二

人须求可入诗，物须求可入画。  
（龚）半千曰：物之不可入画者，猪也，阿堵物也，恶少年也。  
竹坡曰：诗亦求可见得人，画亦求可像个物。  
（石）天外曰：人须求可入画，物须求可入诗，亦妙。  
So live that your life may be like a poem. Arrange things so that they look like they are in a
painting.   
Panchien: There are things that will never look like they are in a painting: pigs, dollar bills, and
juvenile delinquents.   
Chupo: Poems, on the other hand, would also like to be like real life, and paintings would like to
be like things.   
Tienwai: It is also possible to say: "So live as to be like a painting, and arrange furniture so that
the room looks like a poem."

### 人生——之二十三

昔人云，若无花、月、美人，不愿生此世界。予益一语云，若无翰墨、棋、酒，不必定作人
身。  
日戒曰：枉为人身生在世界，急宜猛省。  
天石曰：海外诸国决无 墨棋酒，即有?亦不与吾同，一般有人，何也？
（胡）会来曰：若无豪杰文人，亦不需要此世界。  
An ancient writer said, “Life would not be worth living if there were no moon, no flowers, and no
beautiful women.” I might add, “It might not be important to be born a man, if there were no pen
and paper, and no chess and wine."
Jihchieh: Beware of living in vain!
Tienchih: I am sure that foreigners have no pen and paper and chess and wine, or if they have,
these things must be all different. Why, then, are human beings also born there?
Hueilai: Life would not be worth living without great heroes and writers.   

### 人生——之二十四

愿在木而为樗，愿在草而为蓍，愿在鸟而为鸥，愿在兽而为廌，愿在虫而为蝶，愿在鱼而为
鲲。  
（郑）破水曰：我愿生生世世为顽石。  
悔庵曰：愿在人而为梦。  
慧珠曰：愿在梦而为影。  
That I might be the shy among the trees (which is never cut down because of its worthless timber),
the shy among the grass (which can foretell events), the sea gull among the birds (which merges
with the elements), the chih among animals (a kind of deer which attacks the guilty one), the
butterfly among insects (which flits among flowers), and the kun among fish (which has the
freedom of the ocean).   
Poshui: I wish to be a rock!
Huei-an: I wish to be a dream!
[Miss] Hueichu: I wish to be the shadow in a dream!

### 人生——之二十五

庄周梦为蝴蝶，庄周之幸也；蝴蝶梦为庄周，蝴蝶之不幸也。  
（黄）九烟曰：惟庄周乃能梦为蝴蝶，惟蝴蝶乃能梦为庄周耳。若世之扰扰红尘者，其能有
此等梦乎？
（孙）恺似曰：君于梦之中，又占其梦耶？
含徵曰：周之喜梦为蝴蝶者，以其入花深也。若梦甫酣而乍醒，则又如嗜酒者梦赴席而为妻
惊醒，不得不加痛诟谇矣。  
It was fortunate of Chuangtse to dream of being a butterfly, but a misfortune for the butterfly to
dream of being Chuangtse.   
Chiuyuan: This is unfair to Chuangtse. Only he could have dreamed of being a butterfly.   
Kaisze: Are you dreaming of being a dream interpreter?
Hanchen: Chuangtse had that dream because he was deeply associated with the flowers. Others
might begin such a dream only, and it would be like a man dreaming of starting a wine dinner, to
be rudely waked up by his wife!

### 人生——之二十六

假使梦能自主，虽千里无难命驾，可不羡长房之缩地；死者可以晤对，可不需少君之招魂；
五岳可以卧游，可不俟婚嫁之尽毕。  
九烟曰：予尝谓鬼有时胜于人，正以其能自主耳。  
含徵曰：吾恐上穷碧落下黄泉，两地茫茫皆不见也。  
That one might control one's dreams! Then one could go anywhere one likes, conjure up the spirits
of the past, and set out on a world trip without waiting for the sons and daughters to be married
first.   
Chiuyuan: I sometimes think that ghosts have this advantage over men because they can go where
they like.   
Hanchen: On the other hand, it is possible that ghosts go everywhere in the upper and the nether
world and see nothing at all!

### 人生——之二十七

少年须有老成之识见，老成人须有少年之襟怀。  
含徵曰：今之钟鸣漏尽，白发盈头者，若多收几斛麦，便欲置侧室，岂非有少年之襟怀耶？
独是少年老成者少耳。  
竹坡曰：十七八岁便有妾，亦居然少年老成。  
若金曰：老而腐板，定非豪杰。  
（王）司直曰：如此方不使岁月弄人。  
Young people should have the wisdom of the old, and old people should have the heart of the
young.   
Hanchen: I do see white-haired old men with one foot in the grave take a concubine the moment
they have a better harvest than usual. Don’t they also have "the heart of the young”? But the
young people who have the wisdom of the old are rare.   
Chupo: There are young men who take a concubine at the age of seventeen or eighteen. So they,
too, have the wisdom of the old.   
Jochin: A man who feels old cannot be a great soul.   
Szechih: Living this way, one is not indeed just a plaything of Father Time.   

### 人生——之二十八

躬耕吾所不能，学灌园而已矣；樵薪吾所不能，学薙草而已矣。  
释菌人曰：以灌园薙草自任自持，可谓不薄；然笔端隐隐有非其种者锄而去之之意。  
司直曰：予自名为识字农夫，得毋妄甚？
I cannot hope to be a farmer, but will learn watering flowers; cannot hope to become a woodcutter,
but will be contented with pulling out weeds.   
[Monk] Chunjen: Watering and weeding the garden is after all not a bad life. One feels here,
however, that the author has a hankering to weed out and cast off a lot of things he does not like.   
Szechih: I call myself a "literate farmer”. Is that presumptuous?

### 人生——之二十九

高语山林者，辄不善谈市朝事、审若此则当并废《史》《汉》诸书而不读矣，盖诸书所载
皆古之市朝也。  
竹坡曰：高语者，必是虚声处士。真入山者，方能经纶市朝。  
Recluse scholars often disdain to discuss affairs of the government. But history is full of affairs of
the government. Should one stop reading history, too? They cannot have meant it.   
Chupo: Sometimes, these things are affectations. A real recluse scholar can also assume the helm
of government if he is asked to.   

### 人生——之三十

凡事不宜刻，若读书则不可不刻；凡事不宜贪，若买书则不可不贪；凡事不宜痴，若行善则
不可不痴。  
圣藻曰：行善不痴，是邀名矣。  
A man must not be fastidious about other things, but he must be about reading. He must not be
greedy, except in buying books. He should not be a confirmed addict, except in the habit of doing
good and helping others.   
Shengtsao: One who helps others not as an instinctive habit may be doing so to be talked about.   

### 人生——之三十一

文名可以当科第，俭德可以当货材，清闲可以当寿考。  
（聂）晋人曰：若名人而登科第，富翁而不骄奢，寿翁而又清闲，便是蓬台三岛中人也。  
（范）汝受曰：此亦是贫贱文人无所事事自为慰藉云耳，恐亦无实在受用处也。  
（曾）青藜曰：无事此静坐，一日似两日。若活七十年，便是百四十。此是清闲当寿考注脚。  
To enjoy literary fame can take the place of passing imperial examinations; to manage to live
within one's means can take the place of wealth; to lead a life of leisure can well be the equivalent
of a long life.   
Chinjen: But if a famous scholar also passes the examinations, is rich and has learned to live
simply without being a slave to wealth, and reaches a venerable age and enjoys a life of
leisured--would not such a man be living the life of a fairy?
Jushou: I am afraid that poor scholars like to comfort themselves with this thought. I do not think
one can derive any benefit from it.   
Tsingli: It has been said that if a man will sit idly, he can make a day as long as two days and
therefore have a life span of a hundred forty when he lives to seventy.   

### 人生——之三十二

涉猎虽曰无用，犹胜于不通古今；清高固然可嘉，莫流于不识时务。  
竹坡曰：不合时宜，则可；不达时务，奚其可？
Random reading and browsing are better than not being acquainted with books at all; it is all right
to be detached, but not to be ignorant of the trend of the times.   
Chupo: There is a distinction between resisting conventions and fashions of thought, and being
ignorant of them.   

### 人生——之三十三

有山林隐逸之乐而不知享者，渔樵也，农圃也，缁黄也；有园亭姬妾之乐而不能享、不善享
者，富商也，大僚也。  
弟木山曰：有山珍海错而不能享者，庖人也；有牙签玉轴而不能读者，蠹鱼也，书贾也。  
There are those who have the beauties of forests and hills before their eyes, but do not appreciate
them—the fishermen, woodcutters, peasants, and the black and yellow [Buddhist and Taoist
monks]--and others who have gardens, terraces and women, but often fail to enjoy them for lack
of time or of culture--the rich merchants and high officials.   
[Younger brother] Mushan: There are those who have good food and cannot enjoy it--the
cooks--and those who are in daily touch with rare editions and fine bindings but cannot read
them--the moths and book dealers.   

### 人生——之三十四

清宵独坐，邀月言愁；良夜孤眠，呼蛩语恨。  
（黄）孔植曰：此逆旅无聊之况，心斋亦知之乎？
To sit alone at night and invite the moon to tell it one's sorrows; to sleep alone at night and call to
the crickets and pour out one's regrets.   
Kungchih: Shintsai really knows the heart of a lonely traveler abroad.   

### 人生——之三十五

官声采于舆论，豪右之口与寒乞之口俱不得其真；花案定于成心，艳媚之评与寝陋之评概恐
失其实。  
永清曰：我谓众人唾骂者，其人必有可观。  
若金曰：豪右而不讲分上，寒乞而不望推恩者，亦未尝无公论。  
九烟曰：先师有言，不如乡人之善者好之，其不善者恶之。  
An official's reputation comes from public opinion, but that of his close associates and of beggars
of office should be discounted. The reputation of women should come from real knowledge; the
views of fans and superficial critics cannot be trusted.   
Yungching: Sometimes when an official runs into a barrage of opposition, we may be sure that
there is something in that man.   
Jochin: This is not always true. When the close associates are not making a point for their personal
friends or when the beggars are not trying to secure favors, they can be just also.   
Chiuyuan: Confucius had something to say on this, “It is best to be liked by the good men of the
village and hated by the bad."

### 人生——之三十六

多情者不以生死易心，好饮者不以寒暑改量，喜读书者不以忙闲作辍。  
A true lover does not change with the years; a good drinker does not change with the seasons; a
lover of books does not stop reading because of business.   

### 人生——之三十七

立品须发乎宋人之道学，涉世须参以晋代之风流。  
（方）宝臣曰：真道学未有不风流者。  
永清曰：等闲地位，却是个双料圣人。  
云士曰：有不风流之道学，有风流之道学，有不道学之风流，有道学之风流，毫厘千里。  
Build one's character on the foundation of the moral teachings of the Sung Neo-Confucianists
[twelfth century]; but go through life in the spirit of the Chin romanticists [third and fourth
centuries].   
Paochen: A real Confucianist can be quite romantic.   
Yungching: That would make a double-strength saint.   
Yunshih: Some puritans [Neo-Confucianists] are romantic, and some are not. Romanticists are
sometimes Puritans in heart and others not at all. There is a very fine difference.   

### 人生——之三十八

豪杰易于圣贤，文人多于才子。  
竹坡曰：豪杰不能为圣贤，圣贤未有不豪杰，文人才子亦然。  
It is easier to be a hero than a sage, and easier to be a writer than a real genius.   
Chupo: A hero usually is not a sage, but a sage is always a true hero. The same is true of writers
and geniuese.   

### 人生——之三十九

风流自赏，只容花鸟趋陪；真率谁知，合受烟霞供养。  
含徵曰：东坡有云，当此之时，若有所思而无所思。  
In self-contentment, a brilliant man takes his ease with birds and flowers; careless of popular fame,
he regards himself as being served by the hilltop clouds.   
Hanchen: Su Tungpo says,” At such a time, one seems to be thinking of something, and yet is
thinking of nothing. ”

### 人生——之四十

痛可忍而痒不可忍；苦可耐而酸不可耐。  
It is easier to stand pain than to stand an itch; bitter taste is easier to bear than sour.
