《幽梦影》——林语堂译（宇宙万物辑）



### 宇宙万物——之一

春者天之本怀，秋者天之别调。   
（袁）江中﹡曰：得春气者，人之本怀；得秋气者，人之别调。   
天外曰：此是透彻性命关头语。   

﹡上文人生一节中“酒可好，不可骂座”一条，有批注者袁中江，与此批注者岂非一人？  

Spring is the natural disposition of Heaven [the creator]; autumn is one of its varying moods.   
Chiangchung: Men also share the natural disposition of spring, and sometimes also the varying
moods of autumn.   
Tienwai: This goes to the very heart of the universe and of the human spirit.   

### 宇宙万物——之二

古人以冬为三馀，余谓当以夏为三馀。晨起者夜之馀，夜坐者昼之馀，午睡者应酬人事之馀。   
古人诗曰，“我爱夏日长”，洵不诬也。   
The ancient people regarded winter as the “extra” period of rest of the other three seasons. I think
summer may also be considered to have three “extras” or rest periods: the summer morn is the
“extra” of the night, the evening talks are the “extra” of the day’s activities, and the siesta is an
“extra” period for rest from seeing people. It is indeed true as the poet says, “ I love the livelong
summer day.”

### 宇宙万物——之三

诗文之体得秋气为佳，词曲之体得春气为佳。   
含徵曰：调有惨澹，悲伤者亦须相称。   
Prose and poetry are best when they have the spirit of autumn; drama and love ditties are best
when they reflect the mood of spring.   
Hanchen: Autumn is the tragic mood, but the expression of sadness should come naturally.   

### 宇宙万物——之四

雨之为物，能令昼短，能令夜长。   
This thing called rain can make the days short and the night long.   

### 宇宙万物——之五

春雨宜读书，夏雨宜奕棋，秋雨宜检藏，冬雨宜饮酒。   
星远曰：四时惟秋雨最难听。然予谓无分今雨旧雨，听之要皆宜于饮也。   
A rainy day in spring is suitable for reading; a rainy day in summer for playing chess; a rainy day
in autumn for going over things in the trunks or in the attic; and that in winter for a good drink.   
Shingyuan: Among rains in the four seasons, that in autumn is most difficult to bear. But
irrespective of season, the sound of rain is always good for a drink.   

### 宇宙万物——之六

春雨如恩诏，夏雨如赦书，秋雨如挽歌。   
竹坡曰：赦书太多，亦不甚妙。   
A spring rain is like an imperial edict conferring an honor, a summer rain like a writ of pardon,
and an autumn rain like a dirge.   
Chupo: One can have too much of writs of pardon.   

### 宇宙万物——之七

春风如酒，夏风如茗，秋风如烟，冬风如姜芥。   
Spring wind is like wine, summer wind is like tea, autumn wind is like smoke, and winter wind is
like ginger or mustard.   

### 宇宙万物——之八

云之为物，或崔巍如山，或潋滟如水，或如人，或如兽，或如鸟毳，或如鱼鳞，故天下万物
皆可画，惟云不能画。世所画云，亦强名耳。   
竹坡曰：云有反面正面，有阴阳向背，有层次内外。细观其与日相映，则知其明处乃一面，
暗处又一面。尝谓古今无一画云手，不谓《幽梦影》中先得我心。   
The cloud is ever changeful, sometimes piled up like high cliffs, sometimes translucent like water,
and sometimes it resembles human beings or beasts or fish scales or feathers. That is why clouds
are impossible to paint. The so-called paintings of clouds do not quite resemble clouds.   
Chupo: There are front and back and inside and outside among the layers of clouds. One side may
be facing the sun and is bright, while the other is dark. It is true that there has never been a painter
famous for painting clouds.   

### 宇宙万物——之九

新月恨其易沉，缺月恨其迟上。   
（孔）东塘曰：我唯以月之迟早，为睡之迟早耳。   
松坪曰：第勿使浮云点缀尘滓太清足矣。   
青若曰：天道忌盈。沉与迟，请君勿恨。   
One hates the new moon for its declining early and the third-quarter moon for its rising late.   
Tungtang: I can regulate my sleeping hours in accordance with its rising and decline.   
Sungping: Rather the things to look out for are the clouds which may obscure it.   
Chingjo: It is the nature of the universe to go in cycles. Please do not hate its slowness in rising or
its decline.   

### 宇宙万物——之十

月下谈禅，旨趣益远；月下说剑，肝胆益真；月下论诗，风致益幽；月下对美人，情意益笃。   
（袁）士旦曰：溽暑中赴华筵，冰雪中应考试，阴雨中对道学先生，与此况味何如？
This is what the moonlight does: it makes a conversation on Shan [Zen] seem more spiritual and
ethereal, a talk about swordsmanship seem more romantic, a discussion of poetry more charming,
and a woman more enchanting.   
Shihtan: In contrast, imagine attending a formal dinner on a hot day, sitting for an examination on
a snowy day, and facing a puritanical scholar on a dark, rainy day!

### 宇宙万物——之十一

春听鸟声，夏听蝉声，秋听虫声，冬听雪声，白昼听棋声，月下听箫声，山中听松声，水际
听欸乃声，方不虚此生耳。若恶少斥辱，悍妻诟谇，真不若耳聋也。   
竹坡曰：久客者，欲听儿辈读书声，了不可得。   
One does not live in vain to have heard the bird songs in spring, the cicada’s song in summer, the
insects’ chirp in autumn, and the sound of crunching snow in winter, and furthermore, to have
heard the sound of chess in daytime, the sound of flute in moonlight, the sound of winds whistling
through the pines in the mountains, and the sound of rowing oars from across the water. As for the
noise of fighting youths and scolding wives, one would be better off if one were deaf.   
Chupo: One who has lived away from home for long yearns for the sound of one’s children
reciting their lessons.   

### 宇宙万物——之十二

闻鹅声如在白门，闻橹声如在三吴，闻滩声如在浙江，闻赢马项下铃铎声，如在长安道上。   
晋人曰：南无观世音菩萨摩诃萨。   
永清曰：众音寂灭时，又作么生话会。   
The sound of geese makes one think of Nanking, that of creaking oars reminds one of the Kiangsu
lake district; the sound of rapids makes one feel like being in Chekiang, and the sound of bells on
horses’ necks suggests travel on the road to Chang-an [in the northwest].   
Chinjen: Namo Kuanshihyin Bodhisattva Mahasattva! [Means “hallelujah!”]
Yungching: And when all noises of the world stop?

### 宇宙万物——之十三

凡声皆宜远听，惟听琴则远近皆宜。   
名友曰：松涛声、瀑布声、箫笛声、潮声、读书声、钟声、梵声，皆宜远听；惟琴声、度曲
声、雪声，非至近不能得其离合抑扬之妙。   
天池曰：凡色皆宜近看，惟山色远近皆宜。   
All sounds are better listened to from a distance, but that of the string instrument chin is an
exception.   
Mingyu: Sounds of the pine forest, a waterfall, a flute, surfs, the sound of reading, and temple
bells and singing of litany should be listened to from a distance. But the nuances of chin notes, of
singing, and of falling snow can be appreciated only when heard close by.   
Tienchih: All colors are at their best when looked at close by, but the colors of mountainsides are
beautiful whether seen from a distance or close by.   

### 宇宙万物——之十四

松下听琴，月下听箫，涧边听瀑布，山中听梵呗，觉耳中别有不同。   
竹坡曰：其不同处，有难于向不知者道。   
永清曰：识得不同二字，方许享此清听。   
There is a difference when listening to the chin under a pine tree, to a flute under the moonlight, to
a waterfall along a stream, and a Buddhist service up in the mountains.   
Chupo: This difference is difficult to describe.   
Yungching: But it is important to know the difference.   

### 宇宙万物——之十五

鸟声之最佳者，画眉第一，黄鹂、百舌次之，然黄鹂、百舌，世未有笼而畜之者，其殆高士
之俦，可闻而不可屈者耶？
云士曰：“黄鹂住久浑相识，欲别频啼四五声。”来去有情，正不必笼而畜之也。   
The best bird songs are those of the thrush, and next to them those of the oriole and the blackbird.   
But the latter two have never been cage birds. Perhaps they have the soul of high-minded
scholars---they can be heard, but not kept.   
Yunshih: “The oriole has now become familiar with us, and when it departs, it makes four or five
cries, ” says a poem. This seems to indicate a feeling on the part of the bird. There is no need to
cage it.   

### 宇宙万物——之十六

水之为声有四：有瀑布声，有流泉声，有滩声，有沟浍声。风之为声有三：有松涛声，有秋
叶声，有波浪声。雨之为声有二：有梧叶荷叶上声，有承檐溜竹筒中声。   
There are four kinds of noise made by water: in a cataract, in a spring, over rapids, and in ditches.   
Three kinds of noise made by winds: those of “pine surfs”(the whistle of winds over pine forests
as heard from a distance), of autumn leaves, and of waves. Two kinds of noise made by rains: that
of drops on plane leaves and lotus leaves, and of rain water coming down drainpipes into bamboo
pails.   

### 宇宙万物——之十七

目不能自见，鼻不能自嗅，舌不能自舐，手不能自握，惟耳能自闻其声。   
弟木山曰：岂不闻心不在焉，听而不闻乎。兄其诳我哉。   
竹坡曰：心能自信。   
释师昂曰：古德云，眉与目不相识，只为太近。   
The eye cannot see itself, the nose does not smell itself, the tongue cannot taste itself, the hand
cannot clasp itself. Only the ear can hear itself.   
[Younger brother] Mushan: It is the mind that hears it.   
Chupo: The mind can have confidence in itself.   
[Monk] Shih-an: An ancient saying goes, “The eye and the eyebrow never get acquainted with
each other, because they are too close.”

### 宇宙万物——之十八

为月忧云，为书忧蠹，为花忧风雨，为才子佳人忧命薄，真是菩萨心肠。   
淡心曰：洵如君言亦安有乐时耶？
松坪曰：所谓君子有终身之忧者耶？
（黄）交三曰：“为才子佳人忧命薄”一语，真令人泪湿青衫。   
竹坡曰：第四忧，恐命薄者消受不起。   
含徵曰：我读此书时，不免为蟹忧雾。   
竹坡又曰：含徵此言，直是为自己忧蟹耳。   
悔庵曰：杞人忧天，无乃类是。   
It shows the heart of Buddha (misericordia) to worry about clouds with the moon, about moths
with books, about winds and rains with flowers, and to sympathize with beautiful women and
brilliant poets about their harsh fate.   
Tanshin: In that case, one has not a moment’s peace of mind.   
Sungping: A gentleman has deeper worries.   
Chiaosan: To sympathize with the harsh fate of beautiful women and brilliant poets---this makes
one want to cry.   
Chupo: The beauties and the poets will never thank you enough.   
Hanchen: After reading this, I begin to worry about the fog with the crabs.   
Chupo again: Hanchen is really worrying about himself not having crabs.   
Huei-an: These are all far-fetched, like the man of Chi who worried that some day the sky might
fall down.   

### 宇宙万物——之十九

花不可以无蝶，山不可以无泉，石不可以无苔，水不可以无藻，乔木不可以无藤萝，人不可
以无癖。   
（黄）石闾曰：事到可传皆具癖，正谓此耳。   
It is absolutely necessary for flowers to have butterflies, for hills to have springs, for rocks to be
accompanied by moss, for water to have watercress in it, for tall trees to have creepers, and for a
man to have hobbies.   
Shihlu: It is true that “all things that have come to stay originate with someone’s hobby”.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十

赏花宜对佳人，醉月宜对韵人，映雪宜对高人。   
淡心曰：花即佳人，月即韵人，雪即高人。既已赏花醉月映雪，即与对佳人韵人高人无异也。   
含徵曰：若对此君仍大嚼，世间那有扬州鹤。   
竹坡曰：聚花月雪于一时，合佳韵高为一人，吾当不赏而心醉矣。   
See flowers in the company of beautiful women; drink under the moon with charming friends;
take a stroll in the snow with high-minded persons.   
Tanshin: The flower itself is a beauty, the moon is a charming spirit, and snow itself is the
incarnation of purity of heart. So one can enjoy them just as if they were a beauty, a charming
spirit, and a pure-hearted saint even when alone.   
Hanchen: Except that to gorge oneself with rich food at such moments would be contradictory in
spirit. One should not dream of riding on a stork and visiting Yangchow [being a fairy and
enjoying worldly luxury at the same time].   
Chupo: To have these material conditions and such good company at the same time can make one
drunk with happiness without wine.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十一

景有言之极幽而实萧索者，烟雨也；境有言之极雅而实难堪者，贫病也；声有言之极韵而实
粗鄙者，卖花声也。   
（谢）海翁曰：物有言之极俗而实可爱者，阿堵物也。   
竹坡曰：我幸得极雅之境。   
Some moments are exquisite, but really dreary---heavy fog and rain. Some circumstances are said
to be poetic, but really hard to bear---poverty and sickness. Some sounds seem very charming on
paper, but are really coarse---the cry of flower sellers on the streets.   
Haiweng: Some things are said to be very vulgar, but really adorable. That is money.   
Chupo: So I am living in what is considered very “poetic” circumstances.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十二

楼上看山，城头看雪，灯前看月，舟中看霞，月下看美人，另是一番情境。   
（江）允凝曰：黄山看云更佳。   
永清曰：做官时看进士，分金处看文人。   
（毕）右万曰：予每于雨后看柳，觉尘襟俱涤。   
谨庸曰：山上看雪，雪中看花，花中看美人，亦可。   
Things give you a different mood and impression when looked at from a particular place: such as
hills seen from a tower, snow seen from the top of a city wall, the moon seen in lamplight, river
haze seen from a boat, and pretty women seen in the moonlight.   
Yunning: Still better to see the sea of clouds from the top of the Yellow Mountain.   
Yungching: To see the faces of new candidates [chinshih] when one is an official. And to see
scholar’s faces when money is being distributed.   
Yuwan: I often look at willows after a rain. It refreshes one’s spirits entirely.   
Chinyung: It is also possible to enjoy looking at snow from mountaintops, looking at flowers
while walking in the snow, and looking at pretty women in a flower garden.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十三

玩月之法，皎洁则仰观，朦胧则宜俯视。   
A clear moon should be seen from below; a dark or hazy moon should be seen looking down from
a high altitude.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十四

山之光，水之声，月之色，花之香，文人之韵致，美人之姿态，皆无可名状，无可执着，真
足以摄召魂梦，颠倒情思。   
街南曰：以极有韵致之文人，与极有姿态之美人，共坐于山水花月间，不知此时魂梦如何，
情思如何。   
Such things as the color of mountains, the sound of water, the light of the moon, the fragrance of
flowers, the charm of poets, and the expression of beautiful women can not be put into words, yet
they have a power to captivate one’s soul and linger in one’s memories and dreams.   
Chiehnan: Imagine then the meeting of a most interesting poet and a most extraordinary beauty in
a surrounding of hills and water and flowers under the moon---what is going to happen?

### 宇宙万物——之二十五

游玩山水亦复有缘，苟机缘未至，则虽近在数十里之内，亦无暇到也。   
（张）南邨曰：余晤心斋时，询其曾游黄山否，心斋对以未游，当是机缘未至耳。   
云士曰：余慕心斋者十年，今戊寅之冬始得一面，身到黄山恨其晚，而正未晚也。   
One either has or has not the luck to travel and visit places. Without luck, one has no time to visit
the nearest mountain within a few miles of one’s home.   
Nanchun: When I met Shintsai, I asked him if he had gone up the Yellow Mountain. He said he
had not yet. It must be that his luck had not come yet.   
Yunshih: I had been an admirer of Shintsai for ten years, and only met him in the year Mouyin
(A.D. 1698). I regret not having been to the Yellow Mountain earlier, but it is never too late to
mend.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十六

镜中之影，着色人物也；月下之影，写意人物也；镜中之影，钩边画也；月下之影，没骨画
也。月中山河之影，天文中地理也；水中星月之象，地理中天文也。   
（恽）叔子曰：绘空镂影之笔。   
天外曰：此种着色写意能令古今善画人一齐搁笔。   
契掌曰：好影子俱被心斋先生画着。   
Reflections in the mirror are color paintings; forms in the moonlight are drawings in ink.   
Reflections in the mirror are paintings with sharp contours, while the forms in moonlight are
“boneless paintings” (without delineated contours). The hills and rivers in the moon are geography
in heaven, while the reflections of the stars and the moon in water are astronomy on earth.   
Shutse: These lines themselves resemble paintings of elusive shadows and forms.   
Tienwai: Painters both in color and in ink might well stop to think about this.   
Chichang: All good reflections have been seized and put on paper by Shintsai’s pen.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十七

蝶为才子之化身，花乃美人之别号。   
竹坡曰：蝶入花房香满衣，是反以金屋贮才子矣。   
The butterfly is the incarnation of a brilliant scholar, and flower is the poetic name of woman.   
Chupo: The imagery of the butterfly for a scholar originates, I think, in his desire for woman’s
company, even as the butterfly wishes to lose itself among flowers.   

### 宇宙万物——之二十八

因雪想高士，因花想美人，因酒想侠客，因月想好友，因山水想得意诗文。   
竹坡曰：多情语，令人泣下。   
Snow reminds one of a great high-minded scholar; the flower reminds one of a beautiful woman;
wine brings up memories of great cavaliers; the moon makes one think of friends; a beautiful
landscape makes one think of some good verse or prose.   
Chupo: What a passionate soul!

### 宇宙万物——之二十九

当为花中之萱草，毋为鸟中之杜鹃。   
语堂曰：萱草亦称忘忧，而杜鹃则有啼血之说。   
Be the day lily among grass. Do not be the cuckoo among the birds.   
Yutang: The day lily is called “forget-sorrow” and the cuckoo’s song is so sad it is said to shed
tears of blood.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十

花之宜于目而复宜于鼻者，梅也、菊也、兰也、水仙也、珠兰也、木香也、玫瑰也、腊梅也，
馀则皆宜于目者也。花与叶俱可观者，秋海棠为最，荷次之，海棠、酴醾、虞美人、水仙又
次之。叶胜于花者，止雁来红、美人蕉而已。花与叶俱不足观者，紫薇也、辛夷也。   
竹坡曰：以一叶而能胜诸花者，此君也。   
Flowers which are both pretty and have a good smell are the plum, the chrysanthemum, the
[Chinese] orchid, the narcissus, the Chloranthus inconspicua, the banksias rose, the rose, and the
winter sweet. The others are all for the eye. Among those whose leaves as well as flowers are good
to look at, the begonia ranks first, the lotus comes next, and then follow the cherry apple, the
Rubus commersonii [of the rose family], the red poppy, and the narcissus. The amaranth and the
Musa uranoscopus [of the banana family] have prettier leaves than flowers. The crape myrtle and
the magnolia have nothing to recommend themselves either in leaves or in flowers.   
Chupo: That which wins the first place among them all by means of its leaf alone is the bamboo.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十一

梅令人高，兰令人幽，菊令人野，莲令人淡，春海棠令人艳，牡丹令人豪，蕉与竹令人韵，
秋海棠令人媚，松令人逸，桐令人清，柳令人感。   
谨庸曰：读之惊才绝绝，堪采入《群芳谱》中。   
The following flowers create each a mood: the plum flower goes with poetry [which alone of all
flowers blooms in pink against a background of snow], the orchid with seclusion [flowering on
mountain cliffs content with being unseen], the chrysanthemum with the rustic flavor, the lotus
with simplicity of heart, the cherry apple with glamour, the peony with success [power and
wealth], the banana and the bamboo with gentlemanly charm, the begonia with seductive beauty,
the pine tree with retirement, the plane tree with absence of worry, and the willow with
sentimentality.   
Chinyung: These have all their talent (as with scholars) and their glamour (as with women).   

### 宇宙万物——之三十二

凡花色之娇媚者多不甚香，瓣之千层者多不结实，甚矣全才之难也，兼之者其惟莲乎。   
日戒曰：花叶根实，无所不空，亦无不适于用，莲则全有其德者也。   
贯玉曰：莲花易谢，所谓有全才而无全福者也。   
丹麓曰：我欲荔枝有好花，牡丹有佳实，方妙。   
谨庸曰：全才必为人所忌，莲花故名君子。   
语堂曰：莲花出污泥而不染。   
Most flowers that are pretty have no smell, and those that have multilayer petals do not bear fruit.   
How rare is a perfect talent! The lotus, however, has all these attributes.   
Jihchieh: From its root and leaf to its flowers and seeds, the lotus serves a useful purpose.   
Kuanyu: The lotus bloom does not last long. Where one’s talent is perfect, one’s luck isn’t.   
Tanlu: For me, it would be perfect if the litchi had pretty flowers and the peony bore good fruit.   
Chinyung: Perfect talent always invites jealousy. That is why the lotus is honored with the name of
a “gentleman”.   
Yutang: The lotus grows out of mud, but is uncontaminated by it.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十三

以松花为量，以松实为香，以松枝为麈尾，以松阴为步障，以松涛为鼓吹。山居得乔松百馀
章，真乃受用不尽。   
（施）愚山曰：君独不记曾有松多大蚁之恨耶。   
含徵曰：松多大蚁，不妨便为蚁王。   
天外曰：坐乔松下如坐水晶宫中，见万顷波涛总在头上，真仙境也。   
One can use the pine flower for measurement, its seeds for perfume, its branches for a duster to
drive away insects, its big shade for cover, and the wind whistling through it as music. Thus a man
living in the country with a hundred pine trees benefits from them in many ways.   
Yushan: But don’t forget that you regretted that large ants are found near it.   
Hanchen: Why not imagine yourself the king of ants?
Tienwai: One can lie under tall pines and imagine one self in an undersea crystal palace with the
surfs surging overhead.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十四

笋为蔬中尤物，荔枝为果中尤物，蟹为水族中尤物，酒为饮食中尤物，月为天文中尤物，西
湖为山水中尤物，词曲为文字中尤物。   
The bamboo shoot is unique among vegetarian food, and so are the following, each in its class: the
litchi among fruit, the crab among shellfish, wine among drinks, the moon in the firmament, the
West Lake [Hang chow] among hills and water, and the Sung tze [poems of irregular lines written
to music] and the chu [songs for the opera] in literature.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十五

秋虫春鸟尚能调声弄舌，时吐好音，我辈？管拈毫，岂可甘作鸦鸣牛喘。   
永清曰：世皆以鸦鸣牛喘为凤歌鸾唱，奈何。   
Even autumn insects and spring birds can make melodious songs to please the ear. How can we
who write just noises like the mooing of a cow or the cackling of a crow?
Yungching: The cackling of a crow and the mooing of a cow, however, are often taken for poetry.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十六

蝉为虫中之夷齐，蜂为虫中之管晏。   
（吴）镜秋曰：蚊是虫中酷吏，蝇是虫中游客。   
The cicada is the retired gentleman among the insects, and the bee is an efficient administrator.   
Chingchiu: The mosquito is the jailor among insects, and the fly the hobo.   

### 宇宙万物——之三十七

蝇集人面，蚊嘬人肤，不知以人为何物。   
康畴曰：应是头陀转世，意中但求布施也。   
释菌人曰：不堪道破。   
竹坡曰：此《南华》精髓也。   
悔庵曰：正以人之血肉只堪供蝇蚊咀嚼耳。以我视之，人也；自蝇蚊视之，何异腥膻臭腐乎。   
云士曰：集人面者，非蝇而蝇；嘬人肤者，非蚊而蚊。明知其为人也而集之嘬之，更不知其
以人为何物。   
A fly rests on a man’s face, and a mosquito sucks man’s blood. What do these insects take man
for?
Kangchou: They are just monks who beg for alms.   
[Monk] Chunjen: It’s a secret.   
Chupo: This is the essence of Chuangtse’s philosophy [that everything is relative and has its own
standards].   
Huei-an: What do they think? Just good meat and drink. They may even think that we smell like
mutton and relish it.   
Yunshih: There are beings that collect around your face and suck your blood. They are flies and
mosquitoes and yet they are not. But they do suck your blood. What do they consider us people?

### 宇宙万物——之三十八

蛛为蝶之敌国，驴为马之附庸。   
星远曰：妙谕解颐，不数晋人危语隐语。   
交三曰：自开辟以来，未闻有此奇论。   
The spider is the racial enemy of the butterfly, while the donkey is a satellite of the horse.   
Shingyuan: This is like the conversation of the Chin romantics.   
Chiaoshan: I never heard of such talk since the beginning of the world!

### 宇宙万物——之三十九

物之稚者皆不可厌，惟驴独否。   
（黄）略似曰：物之老者皆可厌，惟松与梅则否。   
永清曰：惟癖于驴者则不厌之。   
All babies and the young of animals are lovely, except the donkey colt.   
Liaosze: All things that have grown old are unattractive, except the old plum tree and the old pine.   
Yungching: That depends. There are donkey lovers who think the baby donkey pretty.   

### 宇宙万物——之四十

牛与马，一仕而一隐也；鹿与豕，一仙而一凡也。   
（杜）茶村曰：田单之牛亦曾效力疆场，至马之隐者则绝无之矣。若武王归马于华山之阳，
所谓勒令致仕者也。   
The horse is a public servant, the cow a retired scholar. The deer belongs to fairyland, the pig to
this world.   
Chaochun: Once under General Tien Tan, the cow was used in battle by having its tail set on fire
to rush the enemy lines, but I have never heard of a retired horse. When Emperor Wu set his
cavalry horses free to pasture, this was what is usually called “compulsory retirement”.   

### 宇宙万物——之四十一

人则女美于男，禽则雄华于雌，兽则牝牡无分者也。   
茶村（于皇）曰：人亦有男美于女者，此尚非确论。   
（徐）松之曰：此是茶村兴到之言，亦非定论。   
In human beings, the female is more beautiful than the male. Among birds, the male is prettier
than the female. Among beasts, there is no difference.   
Chaochun: This is not quite true. Sometimes a man is handsomer than a woman.   
Sungtse: Chachun happens to say so at the moment. I don’t think this is his considered opinion.
