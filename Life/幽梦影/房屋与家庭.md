《幽梦影》 ——林语堂译（房屋与家庭辑）


### 房屋与家庭——之一

抄写之笔墨不必过求其佳，若施之缣素则不可不求其佳。诵读之书籍不必过求其备，若以供
稽考则不可不求其备。游历之山水不必过求其妙，若因之卜居则不可不求其妙。  
辟疆曰：外遇之女色不必过求其美，若以作姬妾则不可不求其美。  
永清曰：观其区处条理，所在经济可知。  
One need not be too particular about pen and ink when doing copy work, but should be particular
when writing things to be framed. Also one can have a random collection of books for reading, but
should insist on good, adequate reference works. Likewise, what landscape one sees in passing in
travel is not too important, but that of the place where one is going to build a house and settle
down is of prime importance.  
Pichiang: Women with whom one has casual affairs need not be especially beautiful, but the
mistress one is going to live with at home must be.  
Yungching: There is a sense of relative importance shown in Pichiang’s statement.  

### 房屋与家庭——之二

忙人园亭宜与住宅相连，闲人园亭不妨与住宅相远。  
竹坡曰：真闲人必以园亭为住宅。  
A busy man must plan to have his garden next to his house, but a man of leisure can afford to have
it some distance away.  
Chupo: A real man of leisure would make the garden his home.  

### 房屋与家庭——之三

园亭之妙在丘壑布置，不在雕绘琐屑。往往见人家园亭屋脊墙头雕砖镂瓦，非不穷极工巧，
然未久即坏，坏后极难修葺，是何如朴素之为佳乎。  
弟木山曰：予尝悟作园亭与作光棍二法，园亭之善在多回廊，光棍之恶在能结讼。  
The essential thing in a garden with terraces is plan and composition, and not ornamental details. I
have often seen homes which expended a great deal of effort on such carvings and ornamentations.  
These are difficult to keep in good condition and costly in repairs. Better have a simpler taste.  
[Younger brother] Mushan: It occurred to me that house gardens and crooks have something in
common; garden homes achieve their effect by deceptive curving corridors, and crooks and cheats
play the same game of hide-and-seek with the law.  

### 房屋与家庭——之四

艺花可以邀蝶，累石可以邀云，栽松可以邀风，贮水可以邀萍，筑台可以邀月，种蕉可以邀
雨，植柳可以邀蝉。  
（曹）秋岳曰：藏书可以邀友。  
（崔）莲峰曰：酿酒可以邀我。  
（尤）艮斋曰：安得此贤主人。  
慧珠曰：贤主人非心斋而谁乎。  
永清曰：选诗可以邀谤。  
天池曰：不仁可以邀富。  
Planting flowers invites the butterflies, and in the same way rocks invite clouds, the pine invites
winds, a water pond invites duckweed, a terrace may be said to invite the moon, bananas invite the
rain, and willows invite cicadas.  
Chiuyo: A library attracts friends.  
Lienfeng: The brewing of wine attracts me.  
Kentsai: Where can we find such a host?
[Miss] Hueichu: Shintsai is one.  
Yungching: Making an anthology of poetry invites criticism.  
Tienchih: A grasping nature invites riches.

梅边之石宜古，松下之石宜拙，竹傍之石宜瘦，盆内之石宜巧。  
Different types of rocks should be selected for different places: “primitive” ones should be placed
with the plum tree, rugged, heavy ones near pines, slender slabs near bamboos, and delicate
varieties in a flowerpot or tray.

一日之计种蕉，一岁之计种竹，十年之计种柳，百年之计种松。  
星远曰：千秋之计其著书乎？
竹坡曰：百世之计种德。  
In planting trees, so much depends on in how many years you want to see the results. For
immediate results, choose bananas; planning for one year, choose bamboos, for ten years, willows,
and for a hundred years, pine trees.  
Shingyuan: Planning for a thousand years, write books.  
Chupo: For a hundred generations, plant ”virtue”.

一恨书囊易蛀，二恨夏夜有蚊，三恨月台易漏，四恨菊叶多焦，五恨松多大蚁，六恨竹多落
叶，七恨桂荷易谢，八恨薜萝藏虺，九恨架花生刺，十恨河豚多毒。

天外曰：予另有二恨，一曰才人无行，二曰佳人薄命。  
There are ten kinds of worries or things to look out for: (1) Moths in book bags. (2) Mosquitoes on
summer nights. (3) A leaky terrace. (4) Dry chrysanthemum leaves. (5) Big ants near pines. (6)
Too many fallen leaves of bamboos. (7) Too quick wilting of lotus flowers. (8) Snakes near
creepers. (9) Thorns on a trellis of flowers. (10) Being poisoned from eating globefish.  
Ti-an: There are no big ants near pines on the Yellow Mountain.  
Tienwai: I have two worries or regrets: first, that brilliant men have no character, and secondly
that beautiful women often have tragic lives.  

### 房屋与家庭——之八

窗内人于窗纸上作字，吾于窗外观之，极佳。  
It is wonderful to see from the outside a man writing characters on window paper from the inside.  

### 房屋与家庭——之九

冰裂纹极雅，然宜瘦不宜肥，若以之作窗栏，殊不耐观也。  
Latticework is all right, but it should consist of fine lines. If lines are heavy, it would not look nice
on windows.

养花胆瓶，其式之高低大小须与花相称，而色之浅深浓淡又须与花相反。  
竹坡曰：夫如此，有不甘去南枝而生香于几案之右者乎？名花心足矣。  
（王）宓草曰：须知相反者正欲其相称也。  
The vases used for arranging flowers should be chosen so that their size and shape agree with the
flowers but their dark or light shades of color contrast with them.  
Chupo: With such a regard for beauty, the flowers may be willing to part from their branches
without regret. They will be satisfied with their new home.  
Mitsao: The contrast in shade is for the purpose of making the vase and the flowers look unified in
effect.  

### 房屋与家庭——之十一

虽不善书，而笔砚不可不精；虽不业医，而验方不可不存；虽不工奕，而楸枰不可不备。  
含徵曰：虽不善饮，而良酝不可不藏，此坡仙之所以为坡仙也。  
Certain things must be provided in the home: good pens and ink stone, although the owner himself
is not a calligraphist; a home book of medical recipes, although not a doctor; and a chessboard
although he may not play.  
Hanchen: And a good cellar, although the owner may not drink.  

### 房屋与家庭——之十二

居城市中，当以画幅当山水，以盆景当苑囿，以书籍当朋友。  
A man living in the city must make scrolls of painting serve as a natural landscape, have flower
arrangements in pots serve as a garden, and have books serve as his friends.

如何是独乐乐，曰鼓琴；如何是与人乐乐，曰奕棋；如何是与众乐乐，曰马吊。  
（蔡）铉升曰：与少乐乐，与众乐乐，孰乐？曰不若与少。  
To amuse oneself, play the chin, to amuse oneself with a friend, play chess, and to have general
entertainment, play matiao [a game of cards, ancestor of mahjong].  
Shuansheng: Rather enjoy a small party than a big one.

宜于耳复宜于目者，弹琴也，吹萧也；宜于耳不宜于目者，吹笙也，擪（ye）管也。  
圣许曰：宜于目不宜于耳者，狮子吼之美妇人也。  
Musical instruments that are good to listen to and to look at playing are the chin and the shiao [a
flute]; those good to listen to, but not to look at playing are the sheng [small reed organ held close
to the mouth] and the kuan [oboe-like instrument].  
Shengshu: What is beautiful to look at but not to hear is the scolding and screaming from a
beautiful young wife.  

### 房屋与家庭——之十五

天下器玩之类，其制日工，其价日贱，毋惑乎民之贫也。  
竹坡曰：由于民贫，故益工而益贱，若不贫如何肯贱。  
The quality of things made, vessels, utensils, and toys, has steadily improved in these years, while
their prices have steadily gone down. It must be that the artisans are becoming poorer.  
Chupo: It must be due to poverty. The artisans have no choice, but to put more work into it and
sell a product for less.  

### 房屋与家庭——之十六

镜不幸而遇嫫母，砚不幸而遇俗子，剑不幸而遇庸将，皆无可奈何之事。  
When a good mirror meets an ugly owner, a good inkstone meets a vulgar person, and a good
sword finds itself in the hands of a common general, there is nothing these things can do about it.
